# Timy: Time Tracker & Optimiser
A REST API for time tracking demonstrating Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture principles.

Developed as a part of the course "Advanced Software Engineering" at the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) in Karlsruhe.

## Usage
### Online Demo
An online version of the API is available at [timy.mush-it.com](https://timy.mush-it.com). With it's Swagger UI, exposed at [timy.mush-it.com/swagger-ui](https://timy.mush-it.com/swagger-ui/index.html), you can interact with the API without any additional tools.

I recommend using the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) app with the included [Collection](.postman/Timy%20Collection.postman_collection.json) for more complex requests.
